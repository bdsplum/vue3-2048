# 2048 Clone
This is a [2048](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2048_%28video_game%29) clone written in Vue 3 and Pinia.

## How to play
Use the arrow keys to slide all the tiles in the given direction. Tiles with the same value will be combined, and new tiles will be added with each move. The aim is to get a tile with a value of 2048 (though you can continue afterwards).
